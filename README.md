## Python venv problems

I assume you have installed the pip matplotlib, there is a directory in you root called ~/.matplotlib.

Create a file ~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc there and add the following code: backend: TkAgg

## Deep learning frameworks providing a “Model Zoo”

+ Caffe: https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Model-Zoo
+ TensorFlow: https://github.com/tensorflow/models
+ PyTorch: https://github.com/pytorch/vision

## Implementation

From two alternative, PyTorch was chosen to implement assignments 2 and 3.

No Extra-credit implementations were done.
